implementation of "A novel anomaly detection method for multimodal WSN data flow via a dynamic graph neural network".

## Getting Started
To clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/GuetYe/anomaly_detection.git

cd MMSAD
```
Test process:
```
python test.py
```
Train process:

## Dataset
We use IBRL WSN dataset for experiment. The origin data can be found in http://db.csail.mit.edu/labdata/labdata.html.

The dataset used in this papaer is a part of the IBRL, which is placed in "GLSL/other/cut_IBRL".
